### EduVote - Gamified Voting DApp

#### Project Description
EduVote is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that revolutionizes engagement in educational ecosystems through a gamified voting system. Designed to align with the "Learn Own Earn" philosophy of the EDU Chain, EduVote incentivizes students, educators, and community members to participate in learning activities and governance processes. Users earn engagement points by completing educational tasks or contributing to the platform, which are then converted into voting power using a quadratic formula (power = pointsÂ²). This gamified approach rewards active participation and empowers users to influence decisions within the ecosystem.

The smart contract, deployed on the Sepolia testnet at `0xe9aD139010702186236F8dbf763D81d13231A317`, provides a transparent and tamper-proof system for tracking engagement and votes. Integrated with a sleek Flutter-based frontend, EduVote offers an intuitive user interface where participants can view their points, voting power, and cast votes seamlessly. The DApp aims to enhance educational communities by fostering active involvement, promoting fairness, and leveraging blockchain technology for secure, decentralized governance.

#### Key Features
- **Gamified Engagement**: Earn points through participation, boosting voting power quadratically.
- **Decentralized Voting**: Cast votes securely on-chain with a one-time voting restriction per user.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: View engagement points, voting power, and total votes via the Flutter app.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Built on Ethereum with a smart contract for transparency and immutability.

#### Purpose
EduVote brings value to the EDU Chain ecosystem by combining education, gamification, and governance into a single, user-friendly platform. It encourages continuous learning and community participation while showcasing the potential of blockchain in educational innovation.
